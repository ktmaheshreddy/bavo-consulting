  </p>

    training and education to clients on establishing and investing in a successful business that engages
    in international trade, assisting regarding financial matters, and helps with communication issues
    between companies in the U.S. and Kazakhstan that mutually collaborate.&nbsp;</li>

  <h3 class="my-3">Key Clients</h3>

  <p>Bavo Consulting Inc. targets clients in the U.S. and Kazakhstan and aims to help companies engage in
    international trade with Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan. &nbsp;</p>
  <p> Company’s targets are:&nbsp;</p>
  <li class="m-left"><strong> Startup companies&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <p>Companies often need consulting services to help them navigate the challenges of launching and
    growing a business. Consultants can provide expertise in areas such as business planning,
    financial management, marketing, and operations. They can also offer guidance on legal and
    regulatory compliance, as well as help with identifying and mitigating risks. Start-ups may not have
    the resources or expertise to handle these tasks on their own, and hiring a consultant can provide them
    with the knowledge and support they need to succeed. Bavo Consulting Inc.’s consulting services help
    these businesses gain valuable insights and industry knowledge that can help start-ups differentiate
    themselves in a crowded marketplace and make strategic decisions to stay ahead of the competition.
    Considering there are approximately 72,560 startups in the U.S., the Company has a large potential
    clients base from this target category.&nbsp;</p>

  <li class="m-left"><strong>Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <p>Companies are frequently family-owned and operated, with some in the early stages of growth and
    requiring guidance to progress. Many of these businesses are undergoing a transition from one
    generation to the next, with new owners being eager to achieve high aspirations but lacking in
    market knowledge. To address this challenge, these companies require the guidance of experienced
    consultants, who can provide valuable expertise to bridge the knowledge gap and support small
    businesses in thriving within competitive markets. According to Forbes, 99.9% of businesses
    across the U.S. are small businesses, counting for a total of 33.2 million businesses,
    which represents the large potential client base for the Company’s services.&nbsp;</p>
  <li class="m-left"><strong>Large companies&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <p>Companies need consulting services for a variety of reasons. They may require professional expertise
    in a particular area, such as preparing for a union organizing campaign, leadership training on employee
    engagement, identifying leadership skills gaps, or developing a strategy for improving the employee
    communication structure. Consultants can provide access to more expert knowledge of strategy development
    and implementation, and help identify the real context and basis of management problems. Sometimes
    managers pose the wrong problem, and consultants can help clarify the issue and find solutions.
    Top leaders may need help understanding their people decisions and why they impacted the organization
    the way they did. Companies may also need a labor relations strategy for unionized or union-free
    employees, as well as assistance with employee engagement initiatives. Bavo Consulting Inc.
    will use knowledges and expertise, as well as network of connection to help them deal
    with these issues.&nbsp;</p>
  <li class="m-left"><strong>Women-owned companies&nbsp;</strong></li>
  <p>The National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) reports that there are currently more
    than 11.6 million U.S. firms owned by women, which employ nearly nine million people and generate
    $1.7 trillion in sales. Women are increasingly starting businesses in fields like health care and
    professional services, rather than in higher-revenue industries like construction and trucking.
    However, these businesses may face challenges such as market saturation and lack of funding.
    Consulting services, as such provided by Bavo Consulting Inc. help these companies increase their revenue,
    and receive necessary guidance to boost their performance.&nbsp;</p>
